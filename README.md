### Important note before starting:
The styling in the views index file needs to be copy pasted to the other files you make throughout the project to keep it consistent. If you want to do it with ejs layouts that's also a option.

## WELCOME to the Q2 Assessment!



Move deliberately and methodically through the stories provided below.

__Stay calm and code on!__

## Assessment Overview

**Pokemón Node** is an app where a user can manage trainers and their corresponding
Pokemón to battle in a gym. Users should be able to CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE Pokemón,
as well as assign Pokemón to the gym (details below).

Your app should look at _least_ as good as the wireframes, preferably better.

If you want to use session variables instead of cookies, that is fine.

Your app should use `pg` and `knex`, and your schema should be built
using `migrations`.

Your app should be deployed to Heroku.

## INSTRUCTIONS:

```
Fork and clone this repo
cd into repo
npm install
nodemon
```

* You'll need to create a database called `pokemon-node`
* Write a migration for the pokemon database that creates two tables:
  * pokemon
  * trainers.

### Use the following information to build your migrations (schema):

__trainers__

* id (auto increment)
* name (string)

__pokemon__

* id (auto increment)
* name (string)
* trainer_id (integer)
* cp (integer)  __=>__ cp stands for combat power
* in_gym (boolean)

__After you run your migrations, seed the database by running:__

```
knex seed:run
```

* Inspect your database tables to make sure that you now have trainers and pokemon
* Follow the stories below.


# Use the following Gherkin (User) stories to guide your development:

__You should git add, commit, push, and deploy to Heroku after each story is completed__

### Pokemón and Pokemón CRUD

__#1__

```
As a user
When I go to the root route '/'
Then I am redirected to `/pokemon`
```

__#2__

```
As a user
When I visit /pokemon
Then I see a button to 'Add a New Pokemon'
```

__#3__

```
When I click the 'Add a New Pokemon' button
Then I see a form to add a new Pokemon
```

__#4__

```
When I submit the form to add a new Pokemon
Then I am redirected to the Pokemon home page
And I see my new Pokemon listed
```

__#5__

```
When I visit '/pokemon'
Then I see a list of all Pokemón and their properties
And I see a link to DELETE
And I see a link to EDIT
```

__#6__

```
When I visit the Pokemón home page
And I see all Pokemón
When I click on a Pokemón name
Then I am taken to a show page
And I see all the properties for that Pokemón
And I see the name of that Pokemón's trainer
```
__wireframe not shown, implement your own ideas.__

__#7__

Trainers can acquire Pokemón that will belong exclusively to them.
One trainer can have many Pokemón, but each Pokemón belongs to only one trainer.

```
When I visit the Pokemón home page
And I see all Pokemón
And I click the 'EDIT' link for a Pokemón
Then I am taken to a form
And the form is prefilled with information for that Pokemón
And I see the name of that Pokemón's trainer
And that name is in a drop down menu that also has the names of all the other trainers
```

__#8__

```
When I submit an edit form for a Pokemón
Then I am redirected to the show page for that Pokemón
And I see all new details for my updated Pokemón
```

__#9__

```
When I visit the Pokemón home page
And I see all Pokemón
And I click the 'DELETE' link for a Pokemón
Then I am redirected to the Pokemón home page
And that Pokemón is no longer listed
```


_OVERVIEW of STORY # 10_

* You will be using cookies to keep track of which Pokemón are in the 'gym'.
* You will use cookies to set the values `p1` and `p2` to be the `id `of the two
respective Pokemón in the gym.
* The gym should only hold two Pokemón.
* When you visit the Pokemón home page, if either the `p1` or `p2` cookies is not set,
then you can click 'assign to gym' next to a Pokemón and they will be
'assigned to the gym' (i.e. their id will be assigned to either `p1` or `p2`)
* and their 'in_gym' status in the database will be updated to `true`

__EXAMPLE:__ If you have a Raichu with an id of 22 in the database and you click
'assign to gym' then you would set a cookie p1 with a value of 22.


__NOTE:__ Your database should _always_ be updated to have the current `in_gym`
status of _all_ Pokemón.

__#10__

```
As a user
When I visit the Pokemón home page
And I see all Pokemón
And less than 2 Pokemón are 'in the gym'
Then I see a link 'assign to gym' next to every Pokemón that is not 'in the gym'
```

__#11__

```
When I visit the Pokemón home page
And I see all Pokemón
And there are already 2 Pokemón 'in the gym'
Then I do not see 'assign to gym' links for any other Pokemón
```
__#12__

```
When I go to the Pokemón home page
And I see all Pokemón
And a Pokemón is 'in the gym'
Then I see a link 'remove from gym' next to that Pokemón
And I do NOT see a link 'assign to gym' next to that Pokemón
```

### Trainers

__#1__

```
As a user
When I visit /trainers
Then I see a list of all Trainers
```

__#2__

```
When I click on the name of a Trainer
Then I am taken to a show page
And I see the name of that Trainer
And I see all of the Pokemon they are currently training
```

### In the Gym

__#1__

```
As a user
When I visit the gym home page
And there are no Pokemón assigned to the gym
Then I can select a Pokemón1 from a drop down menu that has all Pokemón names
And I can select a Pokemón2 from a drop down menu that has all Pokemón names
```

__#2__

```
When I visit the gym home page
And there are no Pokemón assigned to the gym
And I select a Pokemón1 from a drop down menu that has all Pokemón names
And I select a Pokemón2 from a drop down menu that has all Pokemón names
When I click 'Add Pokemón to the Gym'
Then I am redirected to the gym home page
And I see my Pokemón 'in the gym'
```

__#3__

```
When I visit the gym home page
And only one Pokemón is 'in the gym'
Then I see a Pokemón name in the Pokemón1 slot
And by the Pokemón2 slot I see a dropdown menu with all Pokemón names
```

__#4__

```
When I visit the gym home page
And only one Pokemón is 'in the gym'
And I select a second Pokemón name from a dropdown menu
And I click the 'Add Pokemón to the Gym' button
Then I am redirected to the gym home page
And I see a Pokemón in the Pokemón1 slot
And I see my selected Pokemón in the Pokemón2 slot
```

__#5__

```
When I visit the gym home page
And only one Pokemón is 'in the gym'
And I select a second Pokemón name from a dropdown menu
And that Pokemón is the SAME Pokemón already in a slot
Then the gym home page is rendered again
And I a see an error message
And that error message says
"A Pokemón cannot fight itself! Please choose a different Pokemón!"
And that message is the color red
```

__#6__

```
When I visit the gym home page
And 2 Pokemón are 'in the gym'
Then I see a Pokemón name in the Pokemón1 slot
And I see a Pokemón name in the Pokemón2 slot
```

__#7__

```
When I visit the gym home page
And two Pokemón are already in the gym
Then I see a 'battle' button
```

__#8__

```
When I visit the gym home page
And only one Pokemón is in the gym
Then I do not see the 'battle' button
```

__#9__

```
When I visit the gym home page
And two Pokemón are already in the gym
And I click the 'battle' button
Then the Pokemón with the higher Combat Power 'wins' the fight
And the winning Pokemón's name is displayed on the page next to the word 'WINNER!'
```
__HINT:__ Would it be simpler if all the data you need is passed in to the view
when the page loads (before the user clicks the button?)? HOWEVER, a Pokemón's
Combat Power should NOT be stored in the cookie. You will need to get that info
from the database.

__#10__

```
When I visit the gym home page
And I click the 'reset' button (or link)
Then all the Pokemón are removed from the gym
```

### Stretch Goals

When I make 2 Pokemón battle
Then the winner's CP is incremented by 20
```

__#2__

* Write a migration that adds an image field to the Pokemón table that takes an
image url.

* Display the image on both the gym and the Pokemón index page.
